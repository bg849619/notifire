# Notifire

This is a quick discord bot I made to send notifications when users leave or join a voice channel, to replace a logging bot that went offline.

It doesn't play music. It doesn't do moderation. It doesn't even ping.

It has one command and one command only: `/configure`

It has no access control at the moment, so you might want to set your guild permissions appropriately.

Oh, and I run it on Kubernetes. You're welcome.
